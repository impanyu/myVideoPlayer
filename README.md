# myVideoPlayer
 This project implements a youtube like web video player . All components are implemented using plain Javascript or JQuery. Playlist is read from an json file. All the watched video progress are stored using browserâ€™s localstorage mechanism, so that the browser can reseek to its saved progress if the page is refreshed. There is also a separate progress bar indicating the buffered video.
